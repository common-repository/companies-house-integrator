== Description ==

COMPANIES HOUSE INTEGRATOR plugin will allow you to search for a company at Companies House and pull that data into your Wordpress site automatically and then assign those import details as a user that you choose.

If you wish to have this feature added to your gateway checkout so users can find their own business details quickly then please get in touch gayr@wearekey.co.uk.


Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.
